Discrete v.s. Continuous
discrete distribution -> vertical lines & gaps in between the bars of the histogram

Skew
more of the values are grouped to the right -> negatively skewed

more of the values are grouped to the left -> positively skewed



Mesokurtic (values cluster in the middle of the distribution - normal)

Leptokurtic ("pointy", values cluster in the peak of the distribution - positive)

Platykurtic ("flat", values cluster in the tails of the distribution - negative).

Using the Pearson calculation,

Mesokurtic (Kurtosis ~3)

Leptokurtic (Kurtosis >3)

Platykurtic (Kurtosis < 3)
